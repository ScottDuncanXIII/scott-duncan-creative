Over 5-6 years, I worked with teams of varying sizes (2-4 Front End Developers, 2-4 Back End Developers, and 1-2 QA specialists) to develop and maintain the majority of their website.",
      "highlights": "One of my primary responsibilities was developing the front end for recurring, themed seasonal event sections, including Valentine's Day, Spring, Summer, Halloween, and Holiday. These sections were built as single-page applications using Vue.js with an Agility CMS and typically featured product listings and detail pages, product and category filters, product inventory by store, and dynamic routing. This same template was also used for the persistent Apple product section, which remains live today. Another key responsibility of mine was developing, updating, and maintaining the annual Flu Shot Finder page. This single-page application helped users check stock levels and book appointments at their local Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacy. It also included a Google Map integration to display store locations and vaccine availability. I was also fortunate enough to participate in several accessibility-focused user tests. The insights gained from observing a person with a disability interact with my work were priceless and truly helped me understand the importance of creating more inclusive and user-friendly builds."

I am grateful to have done the build for their official website.",
      "highlights": "The Yamamoto website boasts a modern design that I helped enhance through animations and transitions using Vue.js and GSAP. I applied a modular approach with a custom WordPress theme and ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) to ensure the build was both flexible and scalable. Accessibility and responsiveness were key priorities, as always with my work. One of the fun touches was implementing the lightning bolt screen wipe effect on the mobile navigation reveal, adding a unique flair to the user experience."

To complement the striking visuals, I incorporated scroll-based transitions, enhancing the overall user experience with motion design.

I also implemented a variety of marketing initiatives, including micro-sites, landing pages, billboards, emails, and Flash banners, significantly enhancing user engagement and brand visibility.

At the click of the “escape” button, the entire website would seamlessly transform into a life-saving resource. It would provide women with emergency advice, practical tips, and vital contact information. For example, articles like 'Essentials for Everyday Life' would instantly change to 'Essentials When Running for Your Life,' offering crucial guidance for women in dangerous situations. It was awarded gold at the 2021 Marketing Awards (Strategy Online)."
